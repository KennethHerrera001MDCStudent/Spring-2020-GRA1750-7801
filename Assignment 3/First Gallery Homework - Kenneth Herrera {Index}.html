	<p style="font-size: 20px">Navel Orange</p>
	<p>The most common orange variety stocked in grocery stores. The navel orange gets its name from its “navel,” which is a second fruit that protrudes slightly at the apex of the orange, resembling that of a human navel. These oranges are on the larger side and have thicker skin, which make them easy to peel for consumption. </p>

	<p style="font-size: 20px">Blood Orange</p>
	<p>Blood oranges have a rich, ruby, almost blood-colored flesh and a thick peel, which is where the name originated from. They are medium-sized fruit and are considered to be the most aromatic in the orange family. Due to their vibrant and crimson color, they also make a great garnish on cakes and desserts. </p>

	<p style="font-size: 20px">Mandarin Orange</p>
	<p>Mandarin oranges are a smaller alternative to the regular orange, with looser skin, a sweeter taste and less acidity. Many orange varieties fall under this Mandarin family tree, like tangerines and clementines. It is usually eaten plain or in fruit salads. </p>

	<p style="font-size: 20px">Tangerine Orange</p>
	<p>Smaller in size and sweeter than the typical orange, the tangerine bares a softer and thinner skin, making them easier to peel. They are also highly effective in combating premature skin aging, as they contain more vitamin C. Peak tangerine season lasts from autumn to spring. </p>

	<img src="Orange Images/Clementine.png" style="width: 600px; border: 5px solid #FFE6C0">
	<p style="font-size: 20px">Clementine Orange</p>
	<p>Clementines have a thin and glossy skin, as well as a flat apex, which results in the fruit having an oval shape as opposed to navel and blood oranges. Clementines have a lower heat requirement, meaning their tolerance to fruit maturity and sensitivity to unfavorable conditions are higher. There are three types of clementines: seedless clementines, clementines (maximum of 10 seeds), and Monreal (more than 10 seeds).</p>
